# Novint-Falcon-Haptic-Feedback-and-3D-Simulation
This project focuses on implementing haptic feedback with the Novint Falcon and integrating it into a Blender 3D simulation environment. It covers exploring the device's physical properties, force feedback modeling, and comparing direct vs. indirect coupling methods to enhance the realism of haptic interactions.
